# Bachelor Thesis 

In this thesis we analyzed the performance in terms of time, concision and precision of two languages for probabilistic programming, namely Anglican and Problog. These languages are tested, requiring their implementations to resolve instances of intrinsically difficult problems, such as solving HARD 3SAT formulas.
