%;;;Consider the decision problem as to whether or not to go ahead with a fund-raising garden party.If we go ahead with the party and it subsequently rains, then we will lose money (since very few people will show up); on the other hand, if we don’t go ahead with the party and it doesn’t rain we’re free to go and do something else fun.
%An extension of the Party problem is that if we decide not to go ahead with the party, we have the opportunity to visit a friend. However, we’re not sure if this friend will be in. The question is should we still go ahead with the party?
